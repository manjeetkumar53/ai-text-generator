## Objective

Design and implement a full stack AI application that provides a simple user interface for interacting with a large language model.

## Brief

Strom is an AI company looking for a Lead Full Stack Developer to demonstrate their skills in developing a user-friendly AI application. The project involves building an AI application that uses a large language model to generate human-like text based on user input. 

The project should be structured as follows:

### Task 1: Set Up the Backend

1.1. Create the necessary server-side logic using your preferred back-end technology (Node.js, Ruby, Python, PHP, Java). 

1.2. Implement a large language model such as GPT-3. You can use OpenAI's GPT-3 or any other similar model.

1.3. Create an endpoint that takes a string of text as input and returns a generated string of text from the language model as output.


### Task 2: Set Up the Frontend

2.1. Construct a simple user interface using your preferred front-end technology (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, jQuery). 

2.2. The interface should include at least an input field for users to enter text and a display area to show the generated text.

2.3. Connect the front-end to the back-end so that when users enter text in the input field, it sends a request to the back-end, and displays the generated text in the display area.


### Task 3: Database and Storage

3.1. Implement a relational database such as MySQL or Postgres. 

3.2. Create a table to store all user inputs and corresponding language model outputs. 

3.3. Whenever a user enters text and receives generated text, save both in the database.


### Task 4: Testing

4.1. Write unit tests for your backend logic ensuring that the language model is returning expected results.


### Evaluation Criteria

- Quality of the code (is it clean, efficient, organized)
- Functionality of the application (does it accomplish the tasks, is it user-friendly)
- Design and structure of the application (is it well designed, does it follow best practices)
- Completeness of the application (are all requirements met, is there extra functionality)

### CodeSubmit 

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch.

Have fun coding! ðŸš€
